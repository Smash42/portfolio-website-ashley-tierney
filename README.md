##  The use of AI
I have used ChatGPT as my choice of Large Language Model to create an AboutView in the Portfolio. 
I gave ChatGPT the prompt that I would be using it ro further develope my portfolio using AI. 
My App.vue context was then copy and pasted into the ChatGPT field. 

Once it gave me the code for my AboutView, I asked it to edit my style to make sure it matched my other sections (Portfolio)

I then added my first block of a short about me, which is similar to that on the home page.
